Spring barley does not need vernalization (overwintering) to produce stalk/head/seed.  Quick growth and high biomass if fertility is good. Good weed suppressor, N scavenger, forage producer. Retains feed quality after heading. Good nurse crop for legumes. Use care when including as a cover crop in a small grain rotation (host for same diseases and pests). Spring barley planted in fall may fail to overwinter due to less winter hardiness than winter barley.\n",
