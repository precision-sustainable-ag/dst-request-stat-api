Needs warm conditions, but very low tolerance to drought or high heat. Prefers light to medium textured well drained soils and performs poorly on heavy, wet, or compacted soil. Fine root system good for topsoil conditioning, but not subsoiling. Purported to be good for unlocking soil phosphorus (P), but that only works in calcareous soils. Tolerant of low pH (5.0). Excellent weed suppressor at high planting rates due to very fast growth (not allelopathy). Blooms and extrafloral nectaries excellent for pollinators and other beneficial organisms. High risk of reseeding if overmature: kill or mow within 7-10 days after first bloom. Sets seed faster than all other covers – if reseeding is a concern, don’t grow in mixes. Easy to kill.

Most winter-hardy cover crop. Best winter cover for low-fertility or acid soils. Tolerates wet soil. Winter cereal rye requires vernalization (overwintering) to flower and will likely fail to flower if planted in spring. Best winter cover for many purposes: excellent for biomass, N scavenging, weed control. Good forage, but low quality after heading. Best choice for roller-crimping. Height, biomass, high C:N ratio at maturity may hinder the growth of a following non-legume cash crop. Potential weed if it sets seed, especially in small grain cash crops. Mixes well with legumes. Can plant later than any small grain, but goes to head early in spring – only barley is earlier.

Research and match varieties to your needs. Similar characteristics to other brassicas such as rapeseed/canola. Most commonly used for insect and disease suppression and adding diversity to mixes. Contains the most bio-toxic compounds, best brassica for bio-fumigation in zones with sufficient heat accumulation to support high biomass production (requires soil incorporation, etc.). Potential for fast fall growth and high biomass with good soil fertility. Well-documented for deep N scavenging in fall. Not known for subsoiling, some varieties may not have a taproot. Winter-hardiness, day-length response, other characteristics vary widely by cultivar. If planted in the spring, may bolt (flower) before it can produce much biomass. Can be a good alternative to buckwheat for weed suppression - slower to flower. Does not form associations with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Host for insects of many related cash crop species used in vegetable crop production.

Excellent fall-planted choice if winter-kill is desired. Fastest-growing fall cover crop option if good fertility is present. Good for suppressing weeds. Winter-killed residues decompose and release N rapidly. May overwinter if snow cover is present to buffer temperature extremes. Plant early and plant at the low end of the recommended seeding rate for large plants that are more likely to winter-kill. Late planting and high seeding rates promote small plants that are more winter hardy but cover crop benefits will be greatly diminished. Acts differently when planted in spring: much less root and top growth, bolts and flowers very quickly.  Some varieties may differ in sensitivity to daylength and thus may be slower to bolt in spring. Terminate prior to seed set to prevent it from becoming a weed. If it survives winter, it can be difficult to terminate. Good in mixes to add diversity, especially with peas and oats, but plant at the low end of the recommended seeding rate range to prevent it from out-competing companions. Plant in mix with a winter-hardy grass such as cereal rye if N leaching over winter/early spring is a concern. Has vigorous top growth and a thicker root than oilseed radish, is slower to bolt when planted in the fall. Unpleasant sulfur-smelling odor can be released as plants decay.

Spring flowers attract pollinators. Low cost to seed. Range of cultivar choices (canola for seed, hybrids for grazing, etc.), characteristics may differ by cultivar.

Dense fibrous root system, top soil conditioner, good weed fighter and N scavenger, top-quality forage. Needs N fertility for high biomass. One of the best cover crop species for interseeding due to ease of establishment under droughty conditions, shade tolerance, and short stature. Annual ryegrass is a key weed in small grains. Do not allow to set seed. Can be hard to terminate in the spring with herbicides and other methods; successful termination dependent on crop growth stage and application timing. Blends of annual ryegrass that mature at different times will make termination more difficult. Mixes well with crimson clover. Shorter than small grains with a lower C:N ratio.

Plant in early summer; does not tolerate cool soils. Fast-grower that reaches 6-12 ft tall, big biomass potential in the presence of lots of soil N. Regrows well after mowing/grazing. Excellent subsoiler with thicker roots than most grasses. Excellent weed suppressor due to competition and allelopathy (caution if next crop is small-seeded). Good forage, but prussic acid and nitrate content can be a problem. Slow drydown will limit dry hay production; chop or wrap for forage. Improved forage types available, cultivars may vary widely. Can produce large amount of biomass; mow or kill in a timely fashion. Can substitute forage sorghum or sudangrass. Mixes well with cowpea and sunn hemp to create a diverse warm-season mixture.

Plant in early summer; does not tolerate cool soils. Fast-grower, big biomass potential in the presence of lots of soil N. Regrows well after mowing/grazing. Excellent subsoiler with thicker roots than most grasses. Excellent weed suppressor due to competition and allelopathy (caution if next crop is small-seeded). Good forage, but prussic acid and nitrate content can be a problem. Slow drydown will limit dry hay production; chop or wrap for forage. Improved forage types available, cultivars may vary widely. Can produce large amount of biomass; mow or kill in a timely fashion. Can substitute forage sorghum or sudangrass. Can substitute sorghum or sorghum-sudangrass. Mix with cowpea, sunn hemp and sunflower for a diverse summer mix.

Plant in early summer; does not tolerate cool soils. Good forage potential in areas with sufficient heat. Will tolerate high mowing (> 18"). Large N fixation potential.  Effectively suppresses root-knot nematodes. Low weed risk, but with enough time can set viable seed. Becomes stemmy as it matures. Inoculate seed; cross-inoculates with cowpea. Certain cultivars contain alkaloids which are poisonous to livestock; check before feeding to animals. Spindly growth habit with narrow leaves seems to make it a better choice for mixes than in monoculture. Mix with sorghum-sudangrass, pearl millet, and sunflower for a diverse warm season mixture.

Lots of small seeds, mow or terminate before they are viable. Growth in the first season is mostly underground, it should not flower; avoid mowing. After overwintering, second season growth is aboveground. Inoculate; cross-inoculates with alfalfa.

Triticale feed quality is generally better than rye, but not as good as wheat (i.e. chop triticale for silage at boot stage).

Fall growth is upright, similar to wheat, so it is slower to provide ground cover and weed suppression than rye. High biomass yield potential is slightly higher than wheat in the fall and similar to rye. Matures later than rye, a little later than wheat. Plant height at heading is shorter than rye. Therefore, spring residue is easier to manage than rye and (assuming same kill date), C:N ratio will be slightly lower than rye. Triticale feed quality is generally better than rye, but not as good as wheat (i.e. chop triticale for silage at boot stage). Does not easily sustain frost damage. Winter triticale varieties typically require vernalization (overwintering) to flower and may stay short and not produce seed if planted in the spring. Spring triticale varieties do not require vernalization (overwintering) to flower and may be less cold hardy than winter triticale varieties if planted in the fall.
