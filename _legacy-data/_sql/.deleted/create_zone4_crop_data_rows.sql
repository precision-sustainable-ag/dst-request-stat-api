Fine root system good for topsoil conditioning, but not subsoiling. Purported to be good for unlocking soil phosphorus (P), but that only works in calcareous soils. Tolerant of low pH (5.0). Excellent weed suppressor at high planting rates due to very fast growth (not allelopathy). Blooms and extrafloral nectaries excellent for pollinators and other beneficial organisms. High risk of reseeding if overmature: kill or mow within 7-10 days after first bloom. Sets seed faster than all other covers – if reseeding is a concern, don’t grow in mixes. Easy to kill.'),

Best winter cover for many purposes: excellent for biomass, N scavenging, weed control. Good forage, but low quality after heading. Best choice for roller-crimping. Height, biomass, high C:N ratio at maturity may hinder the growth of a following non-legume cash crop. Potential weed if it sets seed, especially in small grain cash crops. Mixes well with legumes.

Moderate to excellent N fixation depending on planting timing. Excellent forage, blooms for pollinators. For fall-seeding, use multi-cut medium or one-cut mammoth varieties. Multi-cut “medium” types best for spring planting. Avoid seed set by harvesting regularly at 1/4 - 1/3 bloom. Mix with grasses like orchardgrass or fescue to moderate C:N ratio at termination. Consider seeding with spring oat nurse crop at low rate in fall or small grain that will be harvested/mowed to “release” clover understory.

Excellent fall-planted choice if winter-kill is desired. Fastest-growing fall cover crop option if good fertility is present. Good for suppressing weeds. Winter-killed residues decompose and release N rapidly. May overwinter if snow cover is present to buffer temperature extremes. Plant early and plant at the low end of the recommended seeding rate for large plants that are more likely to winter-kill. Late planting and high seeding rates promote small plants that are more winter hardy but cover crop benefits will be greatly diminished. Acts differently when planted in spring: much less root and top growth, bolts and flowers very quickly.  Some varieties may differ in sensitivity to daylength and thus may be slower to bolt in spring. Terminate prior to seed set to prevent it from becoming a weed. If it survives winter, it can be difficult to terminate. Good in mixes to add diversity, especially with peas and oats, but plant at the low end of the recommended seeding rate range to prevent it from out-competing companions. Plant in mix with a winter-hardy grass such as cereal rye if N leaching over winter/early spring is a concern.

Late planting and high seeding rates promote small plants that are more winter hardy but cover crop benefits will be greatly diminished. Acts differently when planted in spring: much less root and top growth, bolts and flowers very quickly. Some varieties may differ in sensitivity to daylength and thus may be slower to bolt in spring. Terminate prior to seed set to prevent it from becoming a weed. Good in mixes to add diversity, especially with peas and oats, but plant at the low end of the recommended seeding rate range to prevent it from out-competing companions.

Host for sclerotinia, so caution when planting prior to legumes. Range of cultivar choices (canola for seed, hybrids for grazing, etc.), characteristics may differ.

Fall growth is upright, similar to wheat, so it is slower to provide ground cover and weed suppression than rye. High biomass yield potential is slightly higher than wheat in the fall and similar to rye. Matures later than rye, a little later than wheat. Plant height at heading is shorter than rye. Therefore, spring residue is easier to manage than rye and (assuming same kill date), C:N ratio will be slightly lower than rye. Triticale feed quality is generally better than rye, but not as good as wheat (i.e. chop triticale for silage at boot stage). Winter kill is more likely if planted early in plant hardiness zone 5 and colder. Due to its later flowering and plant height it is better in a mix with legumes than cereal rye when nitrogen fixation in the spring is the prime objective. Winter triticale varieties typically require vernalization (overwintering) to flower and may stay short and not produce seed if planted in the spring. Spring triticale varieties do not require vernalization (overwintering) to flower and may be less cold hardy than winter triticale varieties if planted in the fall.'),

Not for small grain cash crop rotations (host for same diseases and pests). Fine nurse crop for legumes. Mixes well with winter peas, hairy vetch. Shorter, slower to head means residue easier to manage than rye.
